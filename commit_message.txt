feat: Implement Streamlit frontend and update documentation

This commit introduces the initial version of the Streamlit frontend application, providing an educational and commercial interface for the P2P Dashboard.

Key changes include:
- Created `streamlit_app/` directory with `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `utils/api.py`, and `docs/README.md`.
- Implemented intelligent filters, offer visualization, financial charts (spread, market depth, liquidity curve, weighted average), analytical perspectives, and a notes/feedback panel in the Streamlit app.
- Added educational documentation within the Streamlit app.
- Updated `frontend.md` with the implementation plan.
- Corrected `tradeType` to `trade_type` in `binance_offers.md` and `binance_pair_discovery.md`.
- Removed `binance_supported_pairs.md` as its content is now covered by `binance_pair_discovery.md`.
- Fixed issues in `app.py` related to duplicate `else` blocks, `KeyError` for `tradeType`, and `SettingWithCopyWarning`.
