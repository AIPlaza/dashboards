The application is failing to start due to a `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError`. This error is caused by a `psycopg2.OperationalError`, which indicates that the application cannot resolve the hostname of the database. This is likely due to a misconfiguration of the database URL in the application's environment variables.

**Traceback:**

```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) could not translate host name "dpg-d1omv9ffte5a73bhth20-a" to address: Name or service not known
```
