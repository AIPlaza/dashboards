The `TypeError: init_db() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given` was resolved by modifying the `init_db` function in `p2p_api/database.py` to accept `database_url` as an argument. Additionally, the internal logic of `init_db` was updated to use this passed argument instead of reading from environment variables, and all instances of `effective_url` were replaced with `database_url` for consistency.

**Resolution Steps:**
1.  Modified `def init_db():` to `def init_db(database_url: str):` in `p2p_api/database.py`.
2.  Removed the line `database_url = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")` from `init_db`.
3.  Replaced all occurrences of `effective_url` with `database_url` within the `init_db` function.
