## Setting Up and Verifying the Virtual Environment

Before running the application or tests, it's crucial to set up and activate the virtual environment correctly to ensure all dependencies are installed and accessible.

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    If you haven't already, create a virtual environment in your project directory:

    
```
bash
    python -m venv .venv
    
```
2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**

        
```
bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        
```
*   **On macOS and Linux:**
```
bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        
```
You should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
```
bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
```
4.  **Verify Dependencies:**

    To check for any broken dependencies or conflicts after installation, run:

    
```
bash
    pip check
    
```
This command will report if there are any issues with your installed packages.

5.  **Check Environment Variables (if applicable):**

    If your application relies on environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL`), it's good practice to verify they are set correctly within your activated environment. You can do this using:

    *   **On Windows:**
```
bash
        echo %YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME%
        
```
*   **On macOS and Linux:**
```
bash
        echo $YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME
        
```
Replace `YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME` with the actual name of the environment variable you need to check.

By following these steps, you can ensure your development environment is properly configured, minimizing potential issues related to missing dependencies or incorrect setups.
