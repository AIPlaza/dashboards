# Dependency Installation Report

During the process of running tests, several dependencies had to be explicitly installed, even though most of them were listed in the `requirements.txt` file. This indicates a potential issue with the initial environment setup or the activation of the virtual environment.

## Dependencies Installed and Reasons:

1.  **`pytest`**:
    *   **Reason for installation:** Initially, `pytest` was not found when attempting to run tests, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This suggested that `pytest` was either not installed in the active virtual environment or the Python executable being used by the shell command was not correctly linked to the virtual environment's `pytest` installation.
    *   **Presence in `requirements.txt`:** Yes, `pytest==8.2.2` was present.

2.  **`sqlalchemy`**:
    *   **Reason for installation:** A `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'` occurred during test execution, indicating it was not available in the environment.
    *   **Presence in `requirements.txt`:** Yes, `sqlalchemy==2.0.41` was present.

3.  **`httpx`**:
    *   **Reason for installation:** The `starlette.testclient` module raised a `RuntimeError` stating that `httpx` was required but not installed.
    *   **Presence in `requirements.txt`:** Yes, `httpx==0.27.0` was present.

4.  **`python-dotenv`**:
    *   **Reason for installation:** A `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'` was encountered when the application tried to load environment variables.
    *   **Presence in `requirements.txt`:** Yes, `python-dotenv==1.1.1` was present.

5.  **`psycopg2-binary`**:
    *   **Reason for installation:** An `OperationalError` related to `psycopg2` and an inability to translate the hostname "host" indicated that the PostgreSQL adapter was missing. This was crucial because the application's `DATABASE_URL` was configured for PostgreSQL, and even during testing with an in-memory SQLite, the application's startup logic attempted to import `psycopg2`.
    *   **Presence in `requirements.txt`:** **No, `psycopg2-binary` was NOT present in `requirements.txt`.**

## Missing Documentation/Updates:

The `requirements.txt` file is a good starting point for documenting dependencies. However, it was incomplete as `psycopg2-binary` was a necessary dependency for the application's default configuration (PostgreSQL connection).

**Recommendation:**
The `requirements.txt` file should be updated to include `psycopg2-binary` to ensure all necessary dependencies are explicitly listed and can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that the virtual environment is properly activated and that all `pip install -r requirements.txt` commands are executed within that activated environment to prevent issues where packages are installed globally or not found by the project's Python interpreter.
